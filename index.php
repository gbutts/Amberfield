  <h1>Amberfield Lowline Cattle Stud</h1>

		<p>Amberfield Lowline Cattle Stud is located near Greenmount on the Darling Downs in South
		East Queensland.</p>
		
		<p>The owners are Nina and Geoff Buttsworth.</p>
		
		<p>We commenced operations in mid-2004, starting the stud as a lifestyle choice after a move 
		to the Toowoomba area. We quickly got the bug and commenced developing the concept in earnest.

		<p>In a few quick years, we developed a very successful stud with many <a href=
	    "results.php">award winning</a> stud Lowline 
		cattle, a few commercial cows and calves and a vision to develop some high quality genetics and 
		propagate the breed as it was originally intended.</p>

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>

	    <p>Our aim is simply to breed high quality Lowline cattle. Accordingly, we set up our
	    foundation herd firmly believing in quality over quantity. We had considerable
	    success showing Lowlines, continuing these achievements with our own progeny and now
	    producing quality, tender beef.</p><br />

    <h2>What are our priorities?</h2>

    <h3>Quality</h3>

	    <p>Following our showing successes, we are now focussed on meat quality. We have reduced
	    our herd to the core of our quality breeding stock. In a relatively short period of time, we 
	    have aggregated some quality genetics which we are developing further.</p>
	    
	    <p>We have also produced a high quality bull calf by <abbr title="artificial insemination">AI</abbr> using an
	     award-winning sire and are now seeing these genetics bringing quality animals into our herd.</p>
    
    <h3>Size</h3>

	    <p>There has been a lot of discussion recently on where the beef industry in Australia is
	    heading. Some believe that the continual quest for larger frame size is beginning to have
	    a detrimental effect on some beef, and indeed dairy, breeds. Calving difficulties and the
	    increased cost of maintaining large cattle in non-productive phases and times are two of
	    the problems that have been identified.</p>
	
	    <p>There is a point of view that sooner rather than later beef breeders are going to be
	    forced to reintroduce smaller beast sizes into their herds to redress this imbalance. At
	    Amberfield, we want to be ready when the demand kicks in.</p>

        "right"  hspace="-10" />-->
	    
	    <p>With our Australian Lowlines, we are committed to maintaining the original breed standard.</p>

    <h3>Working with Downlands College</h3>

		<p>We have recently donated some heifers to <a href="http://www.downlands.qld.edu.au/default.asp?contentID=227&amp;categoryID=4"
		target="_blank">Downlands College</a> in Toowoomba. We continue to follow the progress of the 
		students and their Lowline cows, steers and heifers as they develop their skills and experience together.</p>
